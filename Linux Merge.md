The `git merge` command is used to combine the changes from two branches into one. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

### Basic Syntax:


`git merge [branch_name]`

### Steps for a typical merge:

1. **Ensure you're on the target branch**: First, you need to switch to the branch that will receive the changes (usually your main branch like `main` or `develop`).
    
    Example:
    
    `git checkout main`
    
2. **Run the merge command**: Once you're on the target branch, you can merge the changes from another branch into it. For instance, if you want to merge the branch `feature-branch` into your current branch:
    
    
    `git merge feature-branch`
    
    This command will attempt to automatically merge the changes from `feature-branch` into your current branch.
    

### How `git merge` works:

- **Fast-forward merge**: If there are no new commits on the target branch since the branch you're merging was created (i.e., the target branch has no changes of its own), Git will simply move the target branch pointer forward to the latest commit of the source branch.
    
- **Three-way merge**: If both branches have diverged (i.e., both have new commits), Git will create a new commit that combines the changes from both branches. Git automatically handles this merge in most cases, but sometimes conflicts can occur.
    

### Handling Merge Conflicts:

If there are conflicting changes (e.g., if the same part of a file was modified in both branches), Git will mark the file as conflicted, and you will need to manually resolve the conflict.

1. Open the conflicted file(s) and look for conflict markers:
    
    
    `<<<<<<< HEAD (Your branch's changes) ======= (Other branch's changes) >>>>>>> feature-branch`
    
2. Edit the file to resolve the conflict and then remove the conflict markers.
    
3. After resolving the conflict, you need to stage the changes:
    
    
    `git add <file_name>`
    
4. Complete the merge by committing the resolved changes:
    
    `git commit`
    

### Merge Commit:

Once the merge is successful (whether it was fast-forward or a three-way merge), Git creates a merge commit if necessary. This commit has two parent commits: one from the current branch and one from the merged branch.

### Example of the full flow:

1. Switch to `main`:
    
    
    `git checkout main`
    
2. Merge `feature-branch` into `main`:
    

    `git merge feature-branch`
    
3. If there are conflicts, resolve them, stage the changes, and commit:
    
    
    `git add . git commit`
